##Introduction

ACRRM Professional Development Program (PDP) ensures members can access a range of continuing
educational activities to enhance their clinical, management, and professional skills throughout their careers.
Effective professional development is important for continued safe independent general practice, especially
in rural and remote environments, to maintain the highest standards of patient care.
The College has introduced a new framework for the 2020-22 triennium that will meet members’ continuing
professional development needs under the Medical Board’s Professional Performance Framework.
ACRRM is committed to the ethos of life-long learning and encourages all members to access activities that
are relevant to their individual scope of practice. The College PD portfolio has been designed to allow selfreporting within a flexible framework to facilitate the recognition of day-to-day practice-based learning as
well as traditional educational opportunities such as conferences and meetings.
The objectives of the program are to:
• Provide one CPD home that will meet all professional development requirements of ACRRM
members
• Provide a flexible framework of activities that has multiple options within each category for
meaningful professional development that is easy to both obtain and record
• Recognise and respond to the scope and diversity of professional standards required of general
practitioners, particularly those working in rural and remote environments
• Provide a formal process that demonstrates the ongoing professional development activities of
College members for maintaining Fellowship, recognition as a General Practitioner, AHPRA
registration and clinical privileging
• Support members to fulfil their commitments to other professional bodies through crossaccreditation and communication
