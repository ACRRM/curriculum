#### The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine

# Introduction

### Philosophical underpinnings

The Australian College of Rural and remote Medicine (College) views assessment as an
ongoing and integral part of learning. The process is developmental in nature, assists learners
in identifying and understanding their strengths and weaknesses and provides guidance for
additional development. It also enables candidates to become competent, confident and safe
medical practitioners practising independently in their provision of health care to the public.

The College has developed its assessment program based on two key principles:

* Candidates can participate in assessment within the locality where they live and work,
  preventing depopulating rural and remote Australia of their medical workforce (candidates
  and assessors) during assessment period; and
* The content of assessments is developed by clinically active rural and remote medical
  practitioners.

### Programmatic approach

A feature of the College assessment process is the ‘programmatic approach’ i.e. assessment is a ‘program’ across the entire four years of training, rather than a specific instrument or assessment. 

The programmatic approach allows the College to combine assessment methods with different psychometric properties, as well as allowing for a combination of workplace based and standardised assessments.  For example, there is a balance between the clinical assessment in Structured Assessment using Multiple Patient Scenarios (StAMPS), which provides a highly structured and standardised approach, and the Case Based Discussion (CBD), which provides an assessment of the candidate’s clinical practice in their own environment. Each assessment has proven validity and reliability and each measures a different aspect of the candidate’s skills and knowledge. 

Similarly, the Multi-Source Feedback (MSF) and the formative Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (miniCEX) measure different attributes of the candidate’s professional behaviour, one as perceived by patients and colleagues and the other through direct assessor observation.  As each modality measures different aspects of the candidate’s knowledge, skills and attitudes and from a different perspective, the combination of approaches provides a more nuanced and detailed picture. 

Each candidate is required to achieve a minimum of a pass grade in each of the summative assessment modalities, instead of simply totalling the scores and achieving an overall pass score. This ensures that each candidate has the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes as expressed though the educational objectives of the training program.

The combination of modalities ensures that each competency is assessed at least once during the training program, although each individual modality only measures competencies appropriate to the modality of measurement. For example, professionalism is predominantly measured by the MSF assessment, while applied knowledge is predominantly measured by the Multi-Choice Question (MCQ) assessment. 

### Principles of Assessment

Miller (1990) introduced an important framework that can be presented as four tiers/levels of a pyramid to categorise the different levels at which trainees can be assessed throughout their training.

Collectively, the College assessments embrace all four levels of Miller’s Pyramid (Figure 1). Miller emphasised that all four levels - knows, knows how, shows how and does – are required to be assessed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of a trainee’s ability. In other words, that candidates are required to demonstrate that they ‘know’, that they ‘know how’, that they can ‘show how’, and finally, what the candidate actually ‘does’ in the workplace. 

Examples of the assessment tools at each level of College assessments are:

* **Does** (Action):				MSF, formative MiniCEX, Logbook & CBD
* **Shows How** (Performance):	StAMPS, formative MiniCEX, CBD
* **Knows How** (Competence):	StAMPS		
* **Knows** (Knowledge):		MCQs

*`Figure 1: Miller G 1990 The Assessment Clinical Skills/Competence/Performance`*

* **Does:** 			Performance integrated into practice 
* **Shows how:**		Simulated demonstration of skills in an examination situation
* **Knows how:** 		Application of knowledge to medically relevant situations
* **Knows:**			Knowledge or information that the candidate has learned

### Assessors and item writers

The College has a team of writers, editors and assessors. The College aims to include as broad as possible representation of geographic and demographic membership in the team. Core Generalist Training assessment team members are required to be experienced rural practitioners who hold FACRRM. Advanced Specialised Training assessment team members are comprised of a combination of doctors holding Fellowship of ACRRM (FACRRM) and Fellows of other relevant specialist medical colleges.

All College Assessors undergo training throughout their time in the role of Assessor. 

The “expert team” developing assessment items for MCQ and StAMPS has input from a larger group of practising rural doctors. 

The College uses several processes to evaluate the effectiveness of the Fellows who contribute to assessment modalities. Post-assessment feedback from candidates, assessors, invigilators and others involved in assessment is evaluated routinely after each assessment. This information is reviewed by the lead assessors and fed back to the assessors and/or writers as appropriate.

### Code of Conduct

An Assessor must hold current medical registration.

Assessor have a duty to inform the College in writing within 14 days:

* if they are charged with a criminal offence or receive notice of the review of his/her medical registration with a view to suspension or termination; or
* if conditions are imposed or their medical registration is suspended or terminated.

### Conflict of interest

An Assessor is required to declare a conflict of interest with a candidate to the Assessment team prior to the assessment taking place. A declared conflict of interest will be taken into consideration and addressed accordingly.

### Quality assurance processes

The College utilises a range of quality assurance processes in its assessment program.

The College has a documented process for standard setting and definition of the cut-off point between a pass and fail in each of the summative assessment modalities. These are described in the chapters relating to each modality.

Following an assessment, standard question reliability statistics such as Cronbach’s alpha are considered, with reliable questions/items placed in the repository for future assessments or to be included in publicly released practice assessments. Those with poor reliability are redeveloped or retired. 

When StAMPS is delivered across multiple sites, the Assessors assessing the same scenario attend a moderator session together with the lead Assessor to facilitate consistent delivery and marking of the scenario. At each StAMPS assessment centre there is a lead Assessor to ensure that the assessment is delivered in a fair and consistent manner and that process has been adhered to. The lead Assessor will observe Assessors across the assessment session and replace the Assessor when a conflict of interest has been declared. The lead Assessor is also responsible for providing feedback to Assessors. At the conclusion of the StAMPS all Assessors attend a debriefing session which includes an opportunity for Assessors to calibrate their marking. 

As a standard part of College assessment processes, assessments may be recorded. Candidates are notified of when this is occurring and continued participation in the assessment is considered consent to the recording. These recordings are used for the purpose of quality assurance and are the property of the College. Footage obtained will not be released to candidates or the public. Recordings will normally be disposed of confidentially in line with College quality review and documentation management policy after three months.

The College formally evaluates the validity and reliability of each assessment modality prior to finalising results. Formal statistical testing is completed after each MCQ and StAMPS assessment to identify any discrepancies that may suggest that the assessment was not fair for all or some candidates. This analysis includes performance breakdown of each StAMPS scenario for each day and each venue as well as assessor grading and candidate cohort analysis. CBD assessment is formally analysed through regular year-round session review and statistical analysis at the end of each year.

The College conducts ongoing evaluation of the assessment process to ensure fairness and equity for all participants.  After assessments, those involved are invited to provide feedback via an anonymous online survey. 

The results of these processes feed directly back to the training and assessment management team, informing policy and procedure and contribute to the ongoing development and refinement of all processes. This process also provides a formal route to inform the training program about the educational impact of the assessment modalities. 

The Assessment Committee provides oversight of all aspects of the assessment process. This duly constituted committee reports to the Education Council.

### Candidate assessment rules

The following rules apply to the Standardised assessments StAMPS and MCQ:

* Candidates must arrive at the venue early; specific times are provided to candidates who have enrolled 
* Candidates must provide valid photographic identification (e.g. driver’s licence or passport) to the invigilator for verification of identity
* Candidates are not permitted to bring food or drink into the assessment room other than a clear plastic bottle of water or food required for medical reasons 
* Candidates can not take any items into the assessment room except those specified by the College, for example rotation plan for StAMPS
* Mobile phones and all other electronic devices must be turned off and left with the invigilator
* Candidates are strictly prohibited from accessing any aspect of the computer, email or internet sites, other than the virtual assessment or online assessment platform during the assessment
* If a toilet break is required, candidates must be accompanied by an invigilator
* At the end of the exam, candidates must leave all hand-written notes and exam material at the assessment venue
* Candidates must not share any information related to the content of the exam, this is a serious breach of the College’s [Academic Code of Conduct](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/academic-code-of-conduct.pdf?sfvrsn=559890eb_14) and will be dealt with accordingly.

### Venues and Invigilators

All candidates should refer to the relevant [Assessment Venue Requirements](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/handbooks-guides) when choosing an assessment and invigilator.

##### *Venue*

A candidate is required to undertake their assessments at a venue that has been approved by the Assessment team.

The venues in which a candidate can undertake assessments are outlined in the relevant [Assessment Venue Requirements](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/handbooks-guides) document available on the College website. It is the candidate’s responsibility to ensure that the minimum requirements as indicated in the documents below are met.

Assessments cannot be conducted in a private residence (with the exception of Mock StAMPS) and candidates must ensure that the room being used does not contain any reference material and all computers in the room must be turned off

##### *Invigilators*

Invigilators play a central role in ensuring the security of this examination is maintained at all times. Candidates are responsible for finding a suitable invigilator and will be unable to undertake the assessment without an appropriate invigilator. 

All invigilators are subject to approval by the Assessment team, who has the discretionary authority to approve or decline each nominated invigilator. If a nominated invigilator is deemed unsuitable for any reason, the candidate will be notified and required to nominate another invigilator. Invigilators are paid by the College. 

### Incidents or irregularities

A candidate or assessor who has a concern about the management or conduct of the assessment should complete an [Incident Report](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/examination-incident-report-form.pdf?sfvrsn=8a69d668_2). An Incident Report must be provided to the Assessment team within 48 hours of the conclusion of the assessment.

Examples of incidents or other irregularities include but not limited to:

* An uncooperative candidate or assessor
* Not following the assessment procedure 
* Disturbances (e.g. unexpected noisy consulting room)
* Disruptions (e.g. loss of power or telephone malfunction)

### Results

When all post assessment quality assurance processes are complete, a recommendation is presented to the ACRRM Board of Examiners (BoE).  The BoE meets on a regular basis to ratify results.  Candidates are provided with an outcome letter and feedback report (if applicable) shortly after the ratification of results by the BoE.

Once available, results are uploaded to the “My Documents” section of a candidate’s “My College” portal, accessible via the College website. Candidates will receive an email notification once results are uploaded. The dates for release of results are generally published for each assessment on the [Assessment, date and enrolments and fees](https://www.acrrm.org.au/fellowship/discover-fellowship/assessment/assessment-dates-enrolments) webpage.

### Public assessment reports

A report is published on the College website following each Core Generalist Training (CGT), Advanced Specialty Training (AST) Emergency Medicine (EM) StAMPS and MCQ assessment. CBD public reports are published annually. The public report provides assessment statistics, a description of the scenarios/questions, feedback from the Principal Assessor and a summary of stakeholder feedback and improvements planned. The [Assessment Public Reports](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/public-assessment-reports) are published on Assessment resources webpage. 

### Undertaking Assessments Overseas

The College has provisions in place for candidates who wish to undertake their assessment outside of Australia. Candidates who wish to undertake an assessment overseas must contact the Assessment team as soon as practicable for further advice before finalising enrolment.

The MCQ and StAMPS assessments can be completed overseas, subject to appropriate invigilation and technical requirements being met. See [Assessment Venue Requirements](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/examination-venue-requirements.pdf?sfvrsn=12530098_2) for further information.

## Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise

### Introduction

The Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (miniCEX) is a workplace based assessment used to evaluate a candidate’s clinical performance in real life clinical settings.

All candidates training on an ACRRM training program must complete formative MiniCEX assessments for CGT and when undertaking AST in a clinical discipline. Candidates must be in posts accredited by ACRRM for the corresponding stage of training or specific AST discipline. Formative miniCEXs are conducted progressively throughout training. 

In exceptional circumstances a candidate working towards Fellowship may be required to complete a summative miniCEX. This is determined by the College Censor-in-Chief (CIC).

The miniCEX training course for Clinicians - [online course](https://mycollege.acrrm.org.au/search/find-online-learning/details?id=19909&title=MiniCEX+training+course+for+clinicians) is designed for clinicians who are asked to conduct formative miniCEX assessments with ACRRM registrars.

### Requirements

***Core Generalist Training (CGT)***

Nine (9) miniCEX reviews must be submitted to obtain ‘satisfactory completion’ for formative assessment.

MiniCEX reviews are completed progressively during CGT. MiniCEX may include a combination of face-to-face and telehealth consults but requirements cannot be met through telehealth consults only.  

Consults must include a:

* reasonable range of types of consults, age groups and both genders. 
* minimum of five physical examinations, each from a different body system:

  * cardiovascular
  * respiratory
  * abdominal
  * neurological
  * endocrine
  * musculoskeletal region
  * mini-mental state assessment
  * neonatal/paediatric
  * antenatal (first visit)
* detailed history taking of at least one (1) new patient or detailed updating patient database information on a returning patient (of at least medium complexity).

The physical examinations are required to be undertaken in the context of a face-to-face patient consultation. Where possible the reviewer should be viewing the consults face-to-face. A ‘[Physical Exam Reference](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/handbooks-guides)’ document is provided for guidance on undertaking a systematic physical assessment. 

A formative miniCEX can be conducted within the context of the candidate’s medical educator visit or at any time at the instigation of the candidate or supervisor. The miniCEX reviews are to be conducted by a doctor, meeting one of the following criteria: 

* an ACRRM accredited supervisor or 
* holding a Fellowship of ACRRM or
* a Medical Educator from an ACRRM accredited training organisation.

The assessor may be onsite viewing the consults face-to-face or offsite viewing the consults virtually. 

At a minimum three (3) different assessors are required to complete the nine (9) miniCEX assessments. Three (3) of the miniCEX assessments must be conducted by a Medical Educator from an ACRRM accredited training organisation (who does not work in the same workplace as the candidate).

***Advanced Specialised Training (AST)***

Candidates undertaking AST in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health, Adult Internal Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Mental Health, Paediatrics, Palliative Care, Remote Medicine and Surgery are required to have a formative miniCEX conducted on a minimum of five (5) patient interactions (consults) during AST. 

The miniCEX consults should be undertaken progressively during training and include a reasonable range of types of consults, age groups and both genders. The same principles apply around face-to-face and telehealth consults as described for CGT above.

A formative miniCEX can be conducted at any time at the instigation of the candidate or supervisor. The miniCEX assessments must be conducted by a doctor who is an ACRRM accredited supervisor or mentor for the post or holds a Fellowship of the Specialist discipline relevant to the AST.

### MiniCEX format

MiniCEX consists of the following:

* A short encounter between a candidate and patient which is observed by a supervisor. This encounter generally consists of a focused history taking and assessment and takes approximately 15-20 minutes.
* Discussion of patient management and provision of oral and written feedback to the candidate by the supervisor to assist the candidate in planning for future patient encounters. This takes approximately 5-10 minutes.

The process is the same for summative miniCEX except the assessment is undertaken by a College appointed assessor and candidates are not provided with feedback prior to ratification of results.

There are five categories:

1. Communication skills
2. History taking
3. Physical examination
4. Clinical management
5. Professionalism
6. Overall clinical competence

For each consultation, each category is scored:

* Beginning
* Progressing
* Achieved
* Exceeded 

**Achieved rating**

More detailed descriptors for the competency standards for Fellowship- beginning/progressing/achieved are provided in the [Rural Generalist Curriculum](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/training/curriculum). 

For the purpose of fulfilling the mandatory requirements of the miniCEX, it is expected that the physical examination will be a thorough and complete assessment of the relevant system.  See [Physical Exam Reference](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/handbooks-guides) for guidance on the standard expected for physical assessment.

The miniCEX form, patient consent proforma and Physical Exam Reference are available on the [Assessment Resources](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/forms) webpage.

### Roles and responsibilities

***Candidate***

The candidate is responsible for ensuring that they meet the mandatory requirements for miniCEX. A candidate must ensure that completed miniCEX forms are provided to their training organisation. It is also strongly recommended that a copy is uploaded to their College dashboard.

***Assessor***

The assessor observes and scores consultation using ACRRM miniCEX form. 
The assessor provides oral and written feedback to the candidate. 
The completed form is given to the candidate and a copy submitted to the training organisation.

***Training organisation***

The training organisation is responsible for reviewing the completed miniCEX forms and ensuring that any concerns are identified and addressed.

The training organisation monitors that mandatory requirements are met, and that the College is provided with a copy of completed miniCEX forms.

## Multi-Source Feedback

### Introduction

The Multi-Source Feedback (MSF) is a recognised, valid and reliable method of assessing interpersonal and professional behaviour, development and clinical skills. 

All candidates must complete MSF for CGT. The assessment must be undertaken in a post accredited by the College for CGT. MSF cannot be undertaken in a post that is recognised for CGT but not accredited by the College, these include posts accredited by a Postgraduate Medical Council or other specialist colleges.

### Requirements

Candidates are required to demonstrate ‘satisfactory completion’ of at least one MSF. 

Satisfactory completion requires submission of:

* a completed MSF report covering the two (2) components
* a completed reflective exercise and
* evidence of discussion about the report results with a Medical Educator and 
* remediation if required.

The first three (3) components of the MSF process must have fulfilled within four (4) months from the date of enrolment in MSF.

While the MSF is not awarded a pass/fail grad, if concerns are raised in any component of the MSF, the training organisation or College may require the candidate to repeat the MSF or undertake another type of assessment to gain further information or to determine if remediation has been effective. 

Once all the components of the MSF, including remediation if required, have been completed, the MSF outcome is presented to the BoE for ratification. The BoE determines ‘Satisfactory Completion’. 

The MSF must be conducted through Client Focused Evaluations Program (CFEP). The ACRRM version of the MSF is the preferred tool.  Alternate versions of MSF offered by CFEP are also acceptable. Both components of the tool must be completed; however, it is acceptable to undertake the Colleague Feedback Evaluation Tool (CFET) components and Doctors’ Interpersonal Skills Questionnaire DISQ separately. If completed separately a completed reflective exercise is required for each component. See the [CFEP website](https://www.cfepsurveys.com.au/acrrm-doctors) for further information.
