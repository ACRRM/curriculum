#### The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine

## Introduction

### Philosophical underpinnings

The Australian College of Rural and remote Medicine (College) views assessment as an
ongoing and integral part of learning. The process is developmental in nature, assists learners
in identifying and understanding their strengths and weaknesses and provides guidance for
additional development. It also enables candidates to become competent, confident and safe
medical practitioners practising independently in their provision of health care to the public.

The College has developed its assessment program based on two key principles:

* Candidates can participate in assessment within the locality where they live and work,
  preventing depopulating rural and remote Australia of their medical workforce (candidates
  and assessors) during assessment period; and
* The content of assessments is developed by clinically active rural and remote medical
  practitioners.

### Programmatic approach

A feature of the College assessment process is the ‘programmatic approach’ i.e. assessment is a ‘program’ across the entire four years of training, rather than a specific instrument or assessment. 

The programmatic approach allows the College to combine assessment methods with different psychometric properties, as well as allowing for a combination of workplace based and standardised assessments.  For example, there is a balance between the clinical assessment in Structured Assessment using Multiple Patient Scenarios (StAMPS), which provides a highly structured and standardised approach, and the Case Based Discussion (CBD), which provides an assessment of the candidate’s clinical practice in their own environment. Each assessment has proven validity and reliability and each measures a different aspect of the candidate’s skills and knowledge. 

Similarly, the Multi-Source Feedback (MSF) and the formative Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (miniCEX) measure different attributes of the candidate’s professional behaviour, one as perceived by patients and colleagues and the other through direct assessor observation.  As each modality measures different aspects of the candidate’s knowledge, skills and attitudes and from a different perspective, the combination of approaches provides a more nuanced and detailed picture. 

Each candidate is required to achieve a minimum of a pass grade in each of the summative assessment modalities, instead of simply totalling the scores and achieving an overall pass score. This ensures that each candidate has the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes as expressed though the educational objectives of the training program.

The combination of modalities ensures that each competency is assessed at least once during the training program, although each individual modality only measures competencies appropriate to the modality of measurement. For example, professionalism is predominantly measured by the MSF assessment, while applied knowledge is predominantly measured by the Multi-Choice Question (MCQ) assessment. 

### Principles of Assessment

Miller (1990) introduced an important framework that can be presented as four tiers/levels of a pyramid to categorise the different levels at which trainees can be assessed throughout their training.

Collectively, the College assessments embrace all four levels of Miller’s Pyramid (Figure 1). Miller emphasised that all four levels - knows, knows how, shows how and does – are required to be assessed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of a trainee’s ability. In other words, that candidates are required to demonstrate that they ‘know’, that they ‘know how’, that they can ‘show how’, and finally, what the candidate actually ‘does’ in the workplace. 

Examples of the assessment tools at each level of College assessments are:

* **Does** (Action):				MSF, formative MiniCEX, Logbook & CBD
* **Shows How** (Performance):	StAMPS, formative MiniCEX, CBD
* **Knows How** (Competence):	StAMPS		
* **Knows** (Knowledge):		MCQs

*`Figure 1: Miller G 1990 The Assessment Clinical Skills/Competence/Performance`*

* **Does:** 			Performance integrated into practice 
* **Shows how:**		Simulated demonstration of skills in an examination situation
* **Knows how:** 		Application of knowledge to medically relevant situations
* **Knows:**			Knowledge or information that the candidate has learned
