## Introduction

Welcome to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM), the home of the Rural Generalist. 

ACRRM is a professional college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define standards and deliver training in the medical specialty of general practice. 

ACRRM’s standards and training program prepares medical practitioners to practise safely and confidently as rural generalists.  Attainment of Fellowship (FACRRM) leads to specialist registration as a general practitioner with the Medical Board of Australia.

Being a rural generalist means you have specific expertise in providing medical care for rural and remote or isolated communities. As a rural generalist you understand and respond to the diverse needs of rural communities including; applying a population health approach, providing safe primary, secondary and emergency care, culturally safe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s health care and providing specialised medical care in one or more of the Advanced Specialised Training disciplines offered by ACRRM. 

This handbook has been designed to support ACRRM’s training program policies and provide you with comprehensive information to enable you to plan and tailor your training and education needs to attain Fellowship.

## Curriculum

The [Rural Generalist Curriculum](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/training/curriculum) provides a definition of Rural Generalist Medicine and describes the competencies, knowledge, skills and attributes required to be a rural generalist medical practitioner. 

The curriculum informs the training, education and assessment requirements to achieve Fellowship. Therefore, an understanding of the curriculum is essential for all registrars.

The Curriculum competencies are structured under the eight domains of rural and remote practice. 

1. Provide expert medical care in all rural contexts
2. Provide primary care
3. Provide secondary medical care
4. Respond to medical emergencies
5. Apply a population health approach
6. Work with Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, and other culturally diverse communities to improve health and wellbeing 
7. Practise medicine within an ethical, intellectual and professional framework
8. Provide safe medical care while working in geographic and professional isolation

The curriculum consists of Core Generalist and Advanced Specialised components. Registrars must demonstrate meeting all competencies at the Core Generalist standard and choose one specialised area in which they demonstrate meeting the competencies at the Advanced Specialised standard. 

These standards are described in the curriculum. The Curriculum also details the knowledge, skills and attributes in 37 clinical and non-clinical Learning Areas. The Learning Areas all include Core Generalised content and Advanced Specialised content is included for the approved AST disciplines.
