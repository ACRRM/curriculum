## Introduction

Welcome to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM), the home of the Rural Generalist. 

ACRRM is a professional college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define standards and deliver training in the medical specialty of general practice. 

ACRRM’s standards and training program prepares medical practitioners to practise safely and confidently as rural generalists.  Attainment of Fellowship (FACRRM) leads to specialist registration as a general practitioner with the Medical Board of Australia.

Being a rural generalist means you have specific expertise in providing medical care for rural and remote or isolated communities. As a rural generalist you understand and respond to the diverse needs of rural communities including; applying a population health approach, providing safe primary, secondary and emergency care, culturally safe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s health care and providing specialised medical care in one or more of the Advanced Specialised Training disciplines offered by ACRRM. 

This handbook has been designed to support ACRRM’s training program policies and provide you with comprehensive information to enable you to plan and tailor your training and education needs to attain Fellowship.

## Curriculum

The [Rural Generalist Curriculum](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/training/curriculum) provides a definition of Rural Generalist Medicine and describes the competencies, knowledge, skills and attributes required to be a rural generalist medical practitioner. 

The curriculum informs the training, education and assessment requirements to achieve Fellowship. Therefore, an understanding of the curriculum is essential for all registrars.

The Curriculum competencies are structured under the eight domains of rural and remote practice. 

1. Provide expert medical care in all rural contexts
2. Provide primary care
3. Provide secondary medical care
4. Respond to medical emergencies
5. Apply a population health approach
6. Work with Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, and other culturally diverse communities to improve health and wellbeing 
7. Practise medicine within an ethical, intellectual and professional framework
8. Provide safe medical care while working in geographic and professional isolation

The curriculum consists of Core Generalist and Advanced Specialised components. Registrars must demonstrate meeting all competencies at the Core Generalist standard and choose one specialised area in which they demonstrate meeting the competencies at the Advanced Specialised standard. 

These standards are described in the curriculum. The Curriculum also details the knowledge, skills and attributes in 37 clinical and non-clinical Learning Areas. The Learning Areas all include Core Generalised content and Advanced Specialised content is included for the approved AST disciplines. 

## Fellowship Training Program

### Components of training

The training program is aligned to the eight domains of Rural Generalist Curriculum and underpins the learning areas included in the Core Generalist and Advanced Specialised components of the Curriculum.

#### Core Generalist Training

Core Generalist Training (CGT) covers three years of training

* developing broad generalist knowledge, skills and attributes in primary, secondary and emergency care in a rural and remote context, and 
* fostering essential rural generalist knowledge and skills in paediatrics, obstetrics and anaesthetics.

#### Advanced Specialised Training

Advanced Specialised Training (AST) covers one year of training

* building on the core generalist competencies and increasing knowledge and skills in a procedural or non-procedural discipline 
* in a specialised area relevant to the needs of rural communities
* to allow autonomous delivery in a defined scope of specialist clinical practice.

## Training program summary

#### Commencement of training

Registrars who hold general registration and are in post graduate year (PGY) 2 must commence with CGT and undertake the first 12 months full time equivalent (FTE) in a Postgraduate Medical Council (PMC) accredited post. Those who are PGY 3 or above may undertake the first 12 months FTE in a PMC accredited post.

Registrars who hold general registration and are PGY3 or above may commence training with CGT or AST in an ACRRM accredited primary or secondary care training post as applicable.

Registrars who hold limited or provisional registration require an individual training plan approved by the Director of Training at the commencement of training. 

#### Order of training

CGT and AST can be completed:

* Sequentially in either order, providing that prerequisites for the AST have been met or
* concurrently, undertaking CGT and AST part-time.

If AST is undertaken at the beginning of training, a registrar must maintain currency in the discipline until the completion of training.

It is important to plan timing and sequencing of training, education and assessment activities. This training plan should be started at the beginning of training and reviewed regularly throughout training.

## Core Generalist Training

Core Generalist Training (CGT) may be started at PGY 2 or above. Training program requirements must be met in four areas: time, training, education and assessment.\

### Time

CGT requires a minimum of three years full time equivalent (FTE) as described in the [Training Time policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/training-time-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=9e425ba0_8).

### Training

All training must take place in accredited training posts. Training placements must provide the opportunity to gain the required scope, type and volume of clinical experience, at an appropriate level of responsibility. 

ACRRM accredits training posts for CGT in regional, rural or remote areas of Australia. Accredited posts include general practices, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander medical services, hospitals, emergency departments and retrieval services. 

ACRRM accredited training posts are generally suited to doctors who can function competently, with significant responsibility for making patient care decisions, under broad supervision. 

ACRRM recognises training posts accredited by state or territory Postgraduate Medical Council (PMC) as training placements for CGT. These posts are suitable for doctors requiring higher levels of supervision for example doctors who commence training in PGY2.

ACRRM also recognises training posts accredited by other specialist colleges as suitable for short term placements up to three months to fulfil mandatory training requirements. Posts accredited by other specialist colleges may also be suitable for long term placements such as for an AST, however ACRRM accreditation is required. See [Training Placements policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/training-placements-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=ff541e56_8).

#### Regional, rural and remote placements

Registrars are required to work in regional, rural and remote locations and gain experience across primary, secondary and emergency care in rural practice in order to gain the competencies, knowledge, skills and attributes described in the Core Generalist curriculum. All registrars must demonstrate minimum training requirements in these rural contexts. 

While training requirements for primary, hospital and emergency care and rural and remote practice are defined separately they are designed to be covered concurrently. The ideal training placement involves working in a rural general practice, admitting into the local hospital, providing inpatient care and after hours cover in the emergency department. Experience in rural primary, secondary and emergency contexts can also be gained through several training placements.

Example:

*You have worked for 12 months in a rural location in general practice at 0.5 FTE and at the local hospital at 0.5 FTE providing inpatient and emergency care.*

*As such you have now met your minimum training requirements of 12 months rural and remote training as well as six months primary care, three months emergency care and three months inpatient care.*

*You may then to build on your rural primary care and/or rural hospital experience and skills for the remainder of your CGT.*

#### Tertiary hospital placements

Doctors undertaking hospital placements in their junior doctor years must seek a combination of placements that provide generalist skills relevant to rural practice, including where possible the following placements: 

* General medicine
* General surgery
* Emergency
* Paediatrics
* Obstetrics and gynaecology; and
* Anaesthetics.

Other generalist placements that would be helpful to include are:

* Rehabilitation
* Aged care
* Palliative care
* Intensive care 
* Psychiatry
* Emergency (additional placement)

Experienced doctors seeking to meet secondary care requirements must seek placements in rural hospitals where care is provided by generalists rather than large hospitals where care is provided primarily by specialists. 
For further information see [Training Placements policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/training-placements-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=ff541e56_8).

#### *Training requirements*

The training requirements as described in the [Training Program Requirements policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/training-program-requirements-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=ae2186e7_8).
ensure that training is undertaken in all rural contexts. Registrars are encouraged to maximise their training time to gain the required competencies articulated in the [Rural Generalist Curriculum](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/training/curriculum). 

#### Evidence explanation

Where the training occurred in a regular training placement, the regular six monthly supervisor report is acceptable evidence. Where a specific training placement was undertaken, a supervisor report is required for the placement.

## Advanced Specialised Training

Advanced Specialised Training (AST) may be undertaken at any stage of training providing that registrars are at least postgraduate year three or above. It is expected that registrars have core generalist knowledge and skills in the discipline prior to commencing AST. 

### Training

AST may be undertaken as full time or part time training or in two or more blocks as appropriate to the discipline. Training must be undertaken in a training post accredited by ACRRM and be supervised by ACRRM accredited supervisors.

### Education

Registrars are expected to average a minimum of four hours per week engaged in educational activities related to the AST. A record of education must be kept by the registrar and discussed with the Supervisor and Medical Educator regularly throughout training. 

Registrars are expected to participate in the relevant Specialist College registrar education program where this is provided by the Training Post. The Specialist College education program should be supplemented with (or when a program is not provided, replaced with) education activities tailored to the AST curriculum. These education activities may come from a variety of sources. Courses that are provided or accredited by ACRRM are mapped to the Rural Generalist Curriculum to enable relevant courses to be identified. [Search ](https://mycollege.acrrm.org.au/search?query=&clive=acrrm-event-public&collection=acrrm-meta-public)under Online Learning for the relevant curriculum Learning Area provided by ACRRM.

Registrars are encouraged to consider working towards related academic qualifications while undertaking their Advanced Specialised Training; especially when undertaking an AST in Population Health, Remote Medicine, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health, Academic Practice and Mental Health. This may include work towards Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma, or master’s level qualifications in a related area. See Appendix 3.

### Assessment

The following changes apply to registrars who commence an AST in 2021. Registrars who commenced an AST in 2020 or earlier are required to complete the requirements that applied when their AST commenced.

The supervisor report is replaced by a [Plan and Progress Report](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/plan-and-progress-report-advanced-specialised-training.docx?sfvrsn=d722b3cc_2) which begins with a training plan and is updated by the registrar and supervisor every three months. The report is submitted to the training organisation and ACRRM at [training@acrrm.org.au](mailto:training@acrrm.org.au) along with completed workplace based assessments and course certificates.

Registrars are strongly encouraged to complete and submit case based discussions conducted by a supervisor in addition to miniCEXs conducted by their supervisor. In the procedural ASTs some miniCEXs may be replaced by Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS). Formative workplace based assessments forms may be found [here](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/forms).

Information and requirements for each type of assessment are provided in the [Assessment Handbook](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/documents/training-towards-fellowship/handbook-fellowship-assessment.pdf?sfvrsn=42ba86eb_36).
