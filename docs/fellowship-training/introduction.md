## Introduction

Welcome to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM), the home of the Rural Generalist. 
ACRRM is a professional college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define standards and deliver training in the medical specialty of general practice. \

ACRRM’s standards and training program prepares medical practitioners to practise safely and confidently as rural generalists.  Attainment of Fellowship (FACRRM) leads to specialist registration as a general practitioner with the Medical Board of Australia.\

Being a rural generalist means you have specific expertise in providing medical care for rural and remote or isolated communities. As a rural generalist you understand and respond to the diverse needs of rural communities including; applying a population health approach, providing safe primary, secondary and emergency care, culturally safe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s health care and providing specialised medical care in one or more of the Advanced Specialised Training disciplines offered by ACRRM. \

This handbook has been designed to support ACRRM’s training program policies and provide you with comprehensive information to enable you to plan and tailor your training and education needs to attain Fellowship.
