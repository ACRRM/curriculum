title: Competency Standards

The curriculum consists of the Core Generalist and Advanced Specialised components. The
Rural Generalist medical practitioner competencies are common to both components, but the
expected standard for some competencies increases between the Core and Advanced
components.

Registrars must demonstrate meeting all competencies at the Core Generalist standard and
choose one specialised area in which they demonstrate meeting the Advanced Specialised
standard. 

## Core Generalist competency standards

Three indicators are provided for each competency for the Core Generalist standard. These
indicators are markers of progression to meeting the standard of the Core Generalist
component.
