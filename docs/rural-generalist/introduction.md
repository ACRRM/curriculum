### The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine

The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) was formed in 1997 as an
acknowledgment of: 

* the importance of rural and remote medicine as a broad and distinctive form of general
  practice
* the need for well-designed vocational preparation and continuing medical education for
  rural doctors, and
* the need to address the shortage of rural and remote doctors in Australia, by providing
  them with a separate and distinctive professional body

ACRRM is a professional college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define
standards and deliver training in the medical specialty of general practice.

At the time of writing this document, an application to have Rural Generalist medicine
recognised as a protected title and as a specialised field within the speciality of general practice
is being progressed.

## What is a General Practitioner?

The General Practitioner is the doctor with core responsibility for providing comprehensive and
continuing medical care to individuals, families and the broader community. Competent to
provide the greater part of medical care, the General Practitioner can deliver services in the
primary care setting, the secondary care setting, the home, long-term residential care facilities
or by electronic means – wherever and however services are needed by the patient within their
safe scope of practice.

Fellows of ACRRM receive specialist registration as a General Practitioner with the Medical
Board of Australia and can practise in any location throughout Australia.

ACRRM’s curriculum and training program also prepares doctors to be Rural Generalist medical
practitioners. test

## What is a Rural Generalist Medical Practitioner?

A Rural Generalist medical practitioner is a General Practitioner who has specific expertise in
providing medical care for rural and remote or isolated communities. A Rural Generalist medical
practitioner understands and responds to the diverse needs of rural communities: this includes
applying a population approach, providing safe primary, secondary and emergency care,
culturally engaged Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ health care as required, and
providing specialised medical care in at least one additional discipline.

## What is Rural Generalist Medicine?

Rural Generalist Medicine is the provision of a broad scope of medical care by a doctor in the rural context that encompasses the following:

* Comprehensive primary care for individuals, families and communities
* Hospital in-patient care and/or related secondary medical care in the institutional, home
  or ambulatory setting
* Emergency care
* Extended and evolving service in one or more areas of focused cognitive and/or
  procedural practice as required to sustain needed health services locally among a
  network of colleagues
* A population health approach that is relevant to the community working as part of a multi-professional and multi-disciplinary team of colleagues, both
  local and distant, to provide services within a ‘system of care’ that is aligned and
  responsive to community needs. (World Summit on Rural Generalist Medicine, Cairns, 2014).

## What is a Fellow of ACRRM?

A Fellow of ACRRM (FACRRM) is a medical specialist who has been assessed as meeting the
requisite standards for providing high-quality Rural Generalist medical practice.
This involves being able to:

* provide and adapt expert primary, secondary, emergency and specialised medical care
  to community needs;
* provide safe, effective medical care while working in geographic and professional
  isolation;
* work in partnership with Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander peoples and other culturally
  diverse groups; and
* apply a population approach to community needs.

## Domains of Rural and Remote Practice

The eight domains of rural and remote practice describe the contexts of rural and remote
practice.

1. Provide expert medical care in all rural contexts: patient-centred approach, diagnosis,
   management and team work.
2. Provide primary care: whole patient care, longitudinal care, first point of care,
   undifferentiated presentations, care across lifespan, acute and chronic care and
   preventive activities.
3. Provide secondary medical care: inpatient management, respond to deteriorating
   patient, handover, safe transfer and discharge planning.
4. Respond to medical emergencies: hospital & prehospital, resource organisation, initial
   assessment and triage, emergency medical intervention and patient evacuation.
5. Apply a population health approach: community health assessment, population level
   health intervention, statutory reporting and disaster planning.
6. Work with Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, and other culturally diverse communities to
   improve health and wellbeing: strengths-based, respect and understanding
7. Practise medicine within an ethical, intellectual and professional framework: ethical
   practice, clinical documentation, quality and safety, professional obligations, continuous
   learning, leadership, teaching and research.
8. Provide safe medical care while working in geographic and professional isolation:
   resourcefulness, independence, flexibility, technology, professional network and
   extended practice.
