The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) was formed in 1997 as an
acknowledgment of: 

* the importance of rural and remote medicine as a broad and distinctive form of general
  practice
* the need for well-designed vocational preparation and continuing medical education for
  rural doctors, and
* the need to address the shortage of rural and remote doctors in Australia, by providing
  them with a separate and distinctive professional body

ACRRM is a professional college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define
standards and deliver training in the medical specialty of general pr actice.

At the time of writing this document, an application to have Rural Generalist medicine
recognised as a protected title and as a specialised field within the speciality of general practice
is being progressed.

## What is a General Practitioner?

The General Practitioner is the doctor with core responsibility for providing comprehensive and
continuing medical care to individuals, families and the broader community. Competent to
provide the greater part of medical care, the General Practitioner can deliver services in the
primary care setting, the secondary care setting, the home, long-term residential care facilities
or by electronic means – wherever and however services are needed by the patient within their
safe scope of practice.

Fellows of ACRRM receive specialist registration as a General Practitioner with the Medical
Board of Australia and can practise in any location throughout Australia.

ACRRM’s curriculum and training program also prepares doctors to be Rural Generalist medical
practitioners. test

## What is a Rural Generalist Medical Practitioner?

A Rural Generalist medical practitioner is a General Practitioner who has specific expertise in
providing medical care for rural and remote or isolated communities. A Rural Generalist medical
practitioner understands and responds to the diverse needs of rural communities: this includes
applying a population approach, providing safe primary, secondary and emergency care,
culturally engaged Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ health care as required, and
providing specialised medical care in at least one additional discipline.

## What is Rural Generalist Medicine?

Rural Generalist Medicine is the provision of a broad scope of medical care by a doctor in the rural context that encompasses the following:

* Comprehensive primary care for individuals, families and communities
* Hospital in-patient care and/or related secondary medical care in the institutional, home
  or ambulatory setting
* Emergency care
* Extended and evolving service in one or more areas of focused cognitive and/or
  procedural practice as required to sustain needed health services locally among a
  network of colleagues
* A population health approach that is relevant to the community working as part of a multi-professional and multi-disciplinary team of colleagues, both
  local and distant, to provide services within a ‘system of care’ that is aligned and
  responsive to community needs. (World Summit on Rural Generalist Medicine, Cairns, 2014).

## What is a Fellow of ACRRM?

A Fellow of ACRRM (FACRRM) is a medical specialist who has been assessed as meeting the
requisite standards for providing high-quality Rural Generalist medical practice.
This involves being able to:

* provide and adapt expert primary, secondary, emergency and specialised medical care
  to community needs;
* provide safe, effective medical care while working in geographic and professional
  isolation;
* work in partnership with Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander peoples and other culturally
  diverse groups; and
* apply a population approach to community needs.

## Development of the Curriculum

A comprehensive Prospectus1, and a Position Paper2, both published in 1997, established the
need for a curriculum and indicated the major directions for further development.

The first edition of the ACRRM Primary Curriculum was published in 1998. The second edition
was published in 2003, and the third edition in 2006. Minor revisions were made to the third
edition in 2009. The fourth edition (2013) resulted from a major review of both content and
structure involving key stakeholders conducted between October 2009 and January 2010.

The fifth, current edition reflects continued development of the structure and content in
response to developments in medical education including the shift towards competency based
medical education and the work of the Australian National Rural Generalist Taskforce.

The first four editions of the Curriculum were divided into the Primary Curriculum and separate
curricula for each Advanced Specialised Training discipline.

The fifth edition brings together all areas into one curriculum and is titled the Rural Generalist
Curriculum.

The unique nature of Rural Generalist medicine requires a specific curriculum structure, which
includes a combination of multi-specialty learning areas, general non-medical competencies,
non-medical competencies specific to Rural Generalist medicine and specific focus on
interactions with other specialities outside Rural Generalist medicine.

## Curriculum Principles

The Curriculum is underpinned by 10 principles: 

1. Grounded in professional standards

Defines the essential competencies, knowledge, skills and attributes required of General
Practitioners across all working contexts in Australia. Accredited by the Australian Medical
Council in the speciality of general practice.

2. Responsive to community needs

Responds to the diverse needs of the Australian population, including the health needs
and priorities determined by the Australian Government, and the needs expressed by rural
and remote people and communities.

3. Responsive to the rural and remote context

Focuses on the key features that define rural and remote generalist medical practice and
distinguishes it from urban models of generalist medical practice. This includes working
across primary and secondary care, emergency medicine, Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander health, and independence in decision-making and models of collaboration and
support across extensive geography.

4. Integrated rural pathway

Designed to create a rural career pathway through connecting with prevocational rural
education and training programs and continuing post Fellowship with career development
and skills maintenance. Incorporates flexible entry options and recognition of prior learning.

5. Competency-based approach

Defines competencies, knowledge, skills and attributes and incorporates flexible
approaches to gaining and demonstrating competency. Fellowship standards are defined,
and indicators guide progression.

6. Focus on experiential learning

Supports a constructivist teaching and learning approach, involving experience in a variety
of structured placements, with guided and self-directed learning and supervision from
experienced mentors and educators.

7. Relevance to practice

Content is applicable to the current and projected future demands of rural and remote
generalist practice.

8. Validity, reliability and educational soundness

The Curriculum and its related assessment processes are progressive, academically
rigorous, educationally sound, clinically relevant, valid, reliable, and are designed to have
a positive educational impact.

9. Appropriateness and acceptability of delivery and assessment methods

Delivery and assessment methods have been designed to be appropriate and acceptable
to registrars in rural and remote contexts. This is done through distance learning, flexible
delivery methods and interactive approaches.

10. Contribution to improving workforce capacity

Contributes to building a skilled, confident, safe and competent Australian Rural
Generalist medical workforce. 

## Curriculum Overview

The Curriculum is structured around eight Domains of rural and remote practice. Each domain
contains a set of Competencies.

Competencies are observable abilities that require the integration of multiple Knowledge, Skills
and Attributes. The competency Standards describe the Fellowship standard and indicators to
achieving this standard.

37 Learning Areas detail the Knowledge, Skills and Attributes at Core Generalised and where
relevant Advanced Specialised levels. There are both clinical and non-clinical Learning Areas,
drawing on the roles of a doctor identified in the CanMEDs framework.

The Competency Blueprint maps the Learning Areas against the Competencies.

## Domains of Rural and Remote Practice

The eight domains of rural and remote practice describe the contexts of rural and remote
practice.

1. Provide expert medical care in all rural contexts: patient-centred approach, diagnosis,
   management and team work.
2. Provide primary care: whole patient care, longitudinal care, first point of care,
   undifferentiated presentations, care across lifespan, acute and chronic care and
   preventive activities.
3. Provide secondary medical care: inpatient management, respond to deteriorating
   patient, handover, safe transfer and discharge planning.
4. Respond to medical emergencies: hospital & prehospital, resource organisation, initial
   assessment and triage, emergency medical intervention and patient evacuation.
5. Apply a population health approach: community health assessment, population level
   health intervention, statutory reporting and disaster planning.
6. Work with Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, and other culturally diverse communities to
   improve health and wellbeing: strengths-based, respect and understanding
7. Practise medicine within an ethical, intellectual and professional framework: ethical
   practice, clinical documentation, quality and safety, professional obligations, continuous
   learning, leadership, teaching and research.
8. Provide safe medical care while working in geographic and professional isolation:
   resourcefulness, independence, flexibility, technology, professional network and
   extended practice.
